## Report on COVID-19 trends in 5 countries: Portugal, Greece, Czechia, Sweden and Jordan. 

**Link to data set used**: [*COVID-19 data set on
GitHub*](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/blob/master/public/data/cases_deaths/full_data.csv)

This report looks at the monthly cases and deaths as well as the total
cases and deaths. You can use this data set to explore trends by data
visualisation with ggplot2 or using R base functions to get the summary
of each country. It will also help to investigate any trends between
COVID-19 cases over the span of 4 years, for example whether there are
seasonal trends in spikes of cases and deaths.
